_D&D 5e_ can do many things besides combat. However, there's no denying that violence is a significant part of storytelling and the overwhelming part of the _Player's Handbook_ rules. Most _D&D 5e_ sessions have at least one fight, and players need to learn the core mechanics involved in inflicting damage on other creatures.

- Roll a d20. Add the relevant ability score modifier and proficiency bonus.
- Compare the total to the target's Armor Class. If it meets or exceeds it, the target hits.
- If the attack hits, roll the weapon or spell's damage dice and add relevant modifiers.

A _D&D 5e_ attack roll resembles an ability check. Most characters will be proficient with the weapon they wield. Attacks use Strength by default, while finesse and ranged weapons use Dexterity, and spells use different ability scores. Damage involves the base amount of the weapon or spell, such as a longsword's 1d8 or a Fire Bolt's 1d10, plus relevant modifiers. For weapons, this includes ability score modifiers, but it can also include features like Fighting Styles, Sneak Attack, and others.
