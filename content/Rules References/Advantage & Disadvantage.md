D20 rolls make up a vast part of _D&D 5e_ rules. For the most part, they're straightforward. Advantage and disadvantage present a slight wrinkle on the typical formula. They represent a character having a particularly good or poor chance of succeeding. Attacking a prone enemy gives advantage, while attempting to see something distant during a storm might provide disadvantage.

- Make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw as normal, but roll the d20 twice.
- If the character has advantage, take the best of the two results.
- If the character has disadvantage, take the worst of the two results.

The DM can impose advantage or disadvantage on any role they think suits it, using their best judgment. Some rules give a blanket effect, such as attempting to see in dim light or interacting with charmed creatures. Specific _D&D 5e_ class features might also give advantage, such as a barbarian's Reckless Attack feature. If a roll has both advantage and disadvantage, the player only rolls one d20.
