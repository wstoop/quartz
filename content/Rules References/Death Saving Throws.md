Every creature in _D&D 5e_ has hit points. These reflect their luck, stamina, and determination to stay in the fight. When a character takes damage from an attack, spell, or ability, it reduces their hit points by that amount. Characters suffer no ill effects just from losing hit points. They can fight as effectively on one as they can at full health.

- Characters reduce their hit points when they take damage. At zero hit points, they fall unconscious.
- Roll a d20 every turn. On a 10 or higher, the character passes a death saving throw. Any lower, they fail.
- A Natural 20 restores the character to consciousness with one hit point, while a Natural 1 counts as two failures.

Hit points become a problem when a character hits zero. The character falls unconscious and has to make death saving throws. If they fail three, the character dies. This is permanent unless treated with one of _D&D 5e_'s resurrection spells. If they pass three saving throws, they become stable and wake up at 1 hit point in 1d4 hours. Any amount of healing restores a character to full consciousness and capability.
