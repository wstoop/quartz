Saving throws are the third type of core roll inÂ _D&D 5e_. Like attack rolls and [[ability checks]], they involve rolling the d20 and adding the relevant modifiers. Whereas [[ability checks]] and attack rolls decide how the character interacts with the world around them, saving throws determine how well they react when the world fights back.

- Roll a d20 and note the amount.
- Add the relevant ability score modifier, such as Wisdom. Add proficiency bonus if the character is proficient in the given skill.
- If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the effect has reduced or no effect.

Spells often require saving throws from their targets, but they're not the only examples. Traps, dragons' breath, explosions, poisons, and more all force their targets to make saving throws. In many cases, success means the ability has no effect. In others, however, it merely reduces the effect, such as by halving the damage taken.
