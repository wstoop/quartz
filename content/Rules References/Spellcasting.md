Spellcasting is one of the most significant parts of the game that isn't available to all characters. Nine of _D&D 5e_'s 13 character classes are spellcasters, while other characters can get magic in various ways. Even characters without magic should know its fundamentals to help strategize with allies in and out of combat.

- A character casts a spell. If it isn't a cantrip, it typically costs a spell slot from first to ninth level.
- Characters regain their spell slots on a short or long rest, determined by their class.
- If a spell doesn't work automatically, it typically requires an attack roll or saving throw.

Spellcasting is far more restricted than most other features. Only cantrips can be cast at will without other features saying so. Other spells cost slots, of which characters only have a few at each level. Characters must prepare or learn spells from a select list. Choosing the right spells is essential to successful adventuring in _D&D 5e_.
