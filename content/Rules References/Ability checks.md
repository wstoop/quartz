_D&D 5e_ is a game about interacting with a fictional world using dice. Most player actions with a chance of failure will trigger an ability check. This is effectively the game's core mechanic, setting players on course to overcome all sorts of fantasy problems. Fortunately, it's also one of _D&D 5e_'s most straightforward rules.

- Roll a d20 and note the number rolled
- Add the relevant ability score modifier and proficiencies to the total
- If this total equals or exceeds the total set by the DM, the character succeeds at their task

Ability checks can use any of _D&D 5e_'s six ability scores for their modifier. On top of that, they can involve any of the game's many skill proficiencies. It's less daunting, despite this sheer variety, because most _D&D 5e_ character sheets have the totals already written on them. Other features like Bardic Inspiration or Expertise can add new layers to this mechanic, but it's very straightforward in its own right.
