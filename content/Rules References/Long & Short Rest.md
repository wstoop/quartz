Characters don't solely rely on potions and spells to heal them in _D&D 5e_. Resting provides a much more natural and cheap way to recover after difficult encounters. There are two types of rest in _D&D 5e_, short and long. A short rest requires an hour of inactivity, while a long one requires eight hours — usually a full night's sleep.

- Characters can short rest in one hour or long rest in eight.
- Short rests let the character spend limited hit dice to restore hit points while recharging certain class abilities.
- Long rests fully recover hit points, reduce Exhaustion, and restore half a character's hit dice and almost all of their abilities.

Resting doesn't just restore hit points. Most character resources, such as uses of abilities, recharge on either a short rest or a long rest in _D&D 5e_. This varies between classes, races, and subclasses, with most characters having a different balance of rests they prefer. Most adventuring days include time for at least one short rest.
