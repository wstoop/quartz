A ramshackle town nestled between the towering cogwork metropolis of Gamor and the mist-shrouded village of Eldrenwood, known for its Arcane Order presence. Emberhold serves as a neutral ground, a place where Cogsmith tinkerers and arcane scholars can trade and share information (uneasily, at times).
