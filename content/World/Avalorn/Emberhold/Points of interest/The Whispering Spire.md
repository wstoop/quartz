The Whispering Spire rises from the northeastern side of [[Emberhold]], a slender tower constructed from pale grey stone. Arcane runes etched into its surface shimmer faintly with an otherworldly light, especially at night. The tower is adorned with slender, arched windows that appear to glow with an inner light.

### Description
**Ground Floor:**
- A large oak door, reinforced with bands of iron, serves as the entrance. Above the door hangs a weathered sign depicting an open book and a swirling vortex.
- Inside, the ground floor is a brightly lit chamber with a polished stone floor. Shelves line the walls, crammed with leather-bound tomes, scrolls tied with crimson ribbons, and peculiar artifacts glowing with a faint magical aura.
- A wizened Elf with kind eyes and a long white beard sits behind a large oaken desk, meticulously sorting through scrolls. This is **[[Eldarion]],** the tower's caretaker and a scholar of the Arcane Order. He welcomes visitors seeking knowledge and can offer guidance on magical lore, lost rituals, or the history of the Shattering.

**Upper Floors:**
- The upper floors of the Whispering Spire are restricted access, containing the Arcane Order's most valuable texts and artifacts. These floors are said to be warded with magical protections to deter the curious and the malicious.
