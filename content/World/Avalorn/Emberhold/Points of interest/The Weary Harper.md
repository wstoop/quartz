Nestled in the northwest corner of [[Emberhold|Emberhold]], The Weary Harper is a haven for travelers, adventurers, and weary locals alike. It's a two-story building constructed of weathered timber, with a slightly crooked sign depicting a lute hanging above the doorway.

### Description
**Downstairs:**
- The common room is a bustling space filled with worn wooden tables and chairs. A worn tapestry depicting a bard regaling a king hangs on one wall, while the opposite wall boasts a shelf crammed with mismatched tankards, some engraved with names or symbols.
- A large stone fireplace crackles merrily in the corner, casting a warm glow on the room. The air is thick with the scent of roasting meat, ale, and pipeweed.
- Behind the bar, a burly human man with a friendly smile and a weathered face keeps a watchful eye on the patrons. His name is **[[Barnaby]]**, and he's known for his hearty portions and no-nonsense demeanor.

**Upstairs:**
- A narrow staircase leads up to a simple hallway lined with a handful of sparsely furnished rooms. These rooms are basic but clean, offering a bed for the night and a place to store belongings for a modest price.
- The walls are adorned with faded maps and travel posters, remnants of past adventurers who have passed through The Weary Harper.
