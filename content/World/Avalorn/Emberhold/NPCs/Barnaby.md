- A burly human man with a salt-and-pepper beard that permanently bears the stain of spilled ale. Despite his gruff exterior, Barnaby possesses a surprisingly kind heart and an exceptional memory for faces. He wields a tankard with the practiced ease of a seasoned warrior, keeping a watchful eye on the tavern to ensure a lively, yet peaceful atmosphere.
- **Voice:** Booming and authoritative, but tempered with a hint of warmth.
- **Signature Touch:** Barnaby often uses playful nicknames for his regulars, a testament to his ability to create a sense of community within [[the Weary Harper]]. He might surprise even the most seasoned adventurer with a forgotten secret or a whispered rumor gleaned from his patrons.
