- A wizened woman with a kind smile and eyes that gleam with a mischievous twinkle. Time has etched lines on her face, a map of experiences gained through years of traveling the world. Her stall boasts an enticing array of cured meats and smoked fish, each infused with exotic spices and unique flavors.
- **Voice:** Warm and rich, seasoned with a hint of a foreign accent.
- **Signature touch:** Esme loves to share stories of her travels with curious customers, often bartering a good tale for a rare ingredient or a particularly fine cut of cheese.
