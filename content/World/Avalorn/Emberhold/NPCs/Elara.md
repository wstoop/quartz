- A young woman with sun-kissed skin and a warm smile. Her calloused hands speak of years spent tending to her family's farm, while her bright eyes hold the spark of an entrepreneur. Elara's stall overflows with vibrant fruits and vegetables, each arranged with a touch of artistry.
- **Voice:** Cheerful and melodic, like a gentle breeze rustling through leaves.
- **Signature touch:** Elara always offers her customers a taste of the freshest fruit in season, a testament to the quality of her produce.
