- A diminutive gnome with a shock of wild, orange hair that seems to defy gravity. Her nimble fingers fly across a contraption of gears and springs, her brow furrowed in concentration. Thistle's workshop hums with a cacophony of whirring cogs and the occasional "poof!" of a failed experiment. This eccentric inventor is always a step away from a breakthrough (or a spectacular explosion).
- **Signature Touch:**Â Thistle often incorporates salvaged trinkets or scavenged components into her inventions, giving them a unique, ramshackle charm.
