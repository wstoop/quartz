- A shrouded figure whose form is barely discernible within the cluttered confines of their stall. Only glimpses of nimble fingers and flashes of metallic tools are visible as they tinker with salvaged parts and strange trinkets. The Shadow Tinker speaks little, preferring to communicate through gestures and cryptic symbols scrawled on scraps of parchment.
- **Voice:** A raspy whisper, barely audible above the clinking of metal and the whirring of gears.
- **Signature Touch:** The Shadow Tinker leaves behind calling cards – small, intricate metal figurines crafted from scavenged scraps. These figurines, often depicting fantastical creatures or forgotten machinery, are prized by collectors and tinkerers alike.
