- A towering man with a booming voice and a gruff exterior. Brutus, with his thick arms and a perpetually blood-stained apron, cuts an imposing figure. However, beneath his gruffness lies a deep respect for the animals he provides, ensuring only the freshest and finest cuts make it to his display.
- **Voice:** Deep and gravelly, like rocks tumbling down a mountainside.
- **Signature touch:** Brutus takes pride in his butchering skills, offering his customers expert advice on cuts and cooking methods.
