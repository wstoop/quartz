- A nervous gnome with a wild shock of hair that seems to mimic the bubbling concoctions she concocts. Millie's lab is a whirlwind of activity, filled with strange ingredients and vials of shimmering liquids. Despite her nervous demeanor, Millie possesses a remarkable knowledge of alchemy, brewing everything from simple healing elixirs to potent (and potentially explosive) experimental concoctions.
- **Signature Touch:**Â Millie often absentmindedly mutters to herself while brewing, spouting cryptic alchemical formulas that sound more like chants than instructions.
