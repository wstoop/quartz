- A wizened elf with an ageless face etched with the wisdom of centuries. Kind eyes, sparkling with youthful curiosity, peer out from beneath bushy white brows. His long beard, streaked with ink stains, reflects his tireless research. Eldarion's simple, deep blue robes are adorned with subtle arcane symbols that hint at his mastery of ancient lore. He carries himself with quiet dignity, his voice a gentle murmur that carries the weight of forgotten knowledge.
- **Signature Touch:**Â Eldarion has a habit of absentmindedly muttering cryptic phrases in forgotten tongues while lost in thought. He might inadvertently offer a vital clue or a powerful enchantment (if deciphered correctly).
