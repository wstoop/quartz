- A gruff but fair dwarf with a thick beard and a network of wrinkles around his weathered eyes. Bodkin's stall is a treasure trove for aspiring artisans, filled with leather hides of various textures, bolts of cloth in every imaginable color, and basic tools meticulously arranged.
- **Voice:** Gruff and no-nonsense, but laced with a hint of amusement at the enthusiasm of new crafters.
- **Signature touch:** Bodkin, despite his gruff exterior, possesses a surprising amount of patience. He'll readily offer advice on material selection and basic crafting techniques to anyone who asks.
