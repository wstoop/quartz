- A burly dwarf with a thick, blond beard which is somehow spotless, unlike his apron. Borin's muscles bulge with the strength of a thousand hammer blows, and his booming voice echoes through the alley as he works. His gruff demeanor hides a deep respect for craftsmanship, and his keen eye can spot even the most subtle flaw in a weapon or piece of armor.
- **Signature Touch:**Â Borin takes immense pride in his work. Every weapon or armor piece that leaves his forge bears his personal rune, a mark of quality and resilience.
