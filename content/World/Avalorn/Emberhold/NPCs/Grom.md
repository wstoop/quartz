- A gruff dwarf, his imposing frame adorned with dented and scarred armor that whispers tales of countless battles. Grom nurses a tankard of ale, his weathered face etched with stories untold. His booming voice, often punctuated by a hearty laugh, can easily fill the tavern. While Grom might embellish his past exploits (sometimes outrageously), his gruff demeanor and battle-hardened physique leave no doubt of his formidable skills.
- **Signature Touch:**Â Grom has a habit of tapping the hilt of his axe reminiscingly, a habit that seems to both comfort him and intimidate others.
