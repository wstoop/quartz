The Whispering Spire rises from the northeastern side of Emberhold, a slender tower constructed from pale grey stone. Arcane runes etched into its surface shimmer faintly with an otherworldly light, especially at night. The tower is adorned with slender, arched windows that appear to glow with an inner light.

### Description
**Ground Floor:**
- A large oak door, reinforced with bands of iron, serves as the entrance. Above the door hangs a weathered sign depicting an open book and a swirling vortex.
- Inside, the ground floor is a brightly lit chamber with a polished stone floor. Shelves line the walls, crammed with leather-bound tomes, scrolls tied with crimson ribbons, and peculiar artifacts glowing with a faint magical aura.
- A wizened Elf with kind eyes and a long white beard sits behind a large oaken desk, meticulously sorting through scrolls. This is **Eldarion,** the tower's caretaker and a scholar of the Arcane Order. He welcomes visitors seeking knowledge and can offer guidance on magical lore, lost rituals, or the history of the Shattering.

**Upper Floors:**
- The upper floors of the Whispering Spire are restricted access, containing the Arcane Order's most valuable texts and artifacts. These floors are said to be warded with magical protections to deter the curious and the malicious.

### NPCs
  
- **Eldarion:** the caretaker of the Whispering Spire, is a wizened elf with a face etched with the passage of time. His kind eyes, however, still hold a youthful spark of curiosity and a deep love for knowledge. His long white beard flows down his chest, reaching almost to his waist, and is often flecked with ink from his tireless research. He typically wears simple robes of deep blue, adorned with subtle arcane symbols. Eldarion carries himself with a quiet dignity, his voice a gentle murmur that commands respect even from the most boisterous patrons of the Weary Harper.
- **Thistle (Gnome Tinker):** A diminutive gnome with a shock of wild, orange hair tinkers with a contraption of gears and springs at a table. Thistle is an eccentric inventor, always on the cusp of a breakthrough. She might offer to upgrade the player's equipment or provide them with a unique gadget in exchange for rare materials or assistance with her latest project.
