Nestled in the northwest corner of Emberhold, The Weary Harper is a haven for travelers, adventurers, and weary locals alike. It's a two-story building constructed of weathered timber, with a slightly crooked sign depicting a lute hanging above the doorway.

### Description
**Downstairs:**
- The common room is a bustling space filled with worn wooden tables and chairs. A worn tapestry depicting a bard regaling a king hangs on one wall, while the opposite wall boasts a shelf crammed with mismatched tankards, some engraved with names or symbols.
- A large stone fireplace crackles merrily in the corner, casting a warm glow on the room. The air is thick with the scent of roasting meat, ale, and pipeweed.
- Behind the bar, a burly human man with a friendly smile and a weathered face keeps a watchful eye on the patrons. His name is **Barnaby**, and he's known for his hearty portions and no-nonsense demeanor.

**Upstairs:**
- A narrow staircase leads up to a simple hallway lined with a handful of sparsely furnished rooms. These rooms are basic but clean, offering a bed for the night and a place to store belongings for a modest price.
- The walls are adorned with faded maps and travel posters, remnants of past adventurers who have passed through The Weary Harper.


### NPCs
- **Barnaby (Barkeeper),** a burly human man with a salt-and-pepper beard perpetually stained with ale. Despite his gruff exterior, Barnaby has a kind eye and a knack for remembering faces. He wields a tankard like a weapon and keeps a watchful eye on the room, ensuring a lively yet peaceful atmosphere.
- **Grom (Dwarf Fighter):** This gruff dwarf, his armor scarred and dented, sits nursing a tankard of ale. He's a retired adventurer, his tales of past exploits both thrilling and embellished in equal measure. Grom might be persuaded to join the party for a lucrative enough quest, or at least point them in the right direction.
