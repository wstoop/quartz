Almuj, a solitary fortress in the desert, stands weathered yet proud amidst the harsh terrain. Unwanted by the Cogsmiths and the Arcane Order due to its unforgiving environment, the city is ruled by the Ashen March, making it a haven for the strong-willed and a perilous domain for the weak. In this lawless frontier, power is the currency, and survival demands strength and cunning. Amidst the chaos, whispers of hidden treasures and ancient mysteries lure daring adventurers, but only those who can navigate the city's treacherous streets will emerge triumphant.
