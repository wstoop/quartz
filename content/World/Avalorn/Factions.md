## **The Arcane Order**:

  - While they wield formidable magical prowess, the members of the Arcane Order regard technology with a mixture of suspicion and caution. They recognize its utility but fear its potential to upset the natural order of things.

## **The Ashen March**:
- The Ashen March is a grim testament to the resilience and resourcefulness of Orcs, Goblins and those who inhabit the desolate wastelands of Aethel. Unlike the other cultures, they thrive amidst the ruins of former civilizations, scavenging for survival in a harsh and unforgiving landscape.
  - These rugged nomads are masters of survival, exploiting the magical wastelands for valuable materials and salvaging artifacts from the remnants of bygone eras. However, their methods are often ruthless, and they are feared by both the Cogsmiths and the Arcane Order for their willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals.
- Despite their reputation as raiders and scavengers, the Ashen March possesses a fierce sense of pride and unity, forging bonds of kinship that transcend individual differences. In their eyes, strength and cunning are virtues to be admired, and they will stop at nothing to ensure the survival and prosperity of their people.
