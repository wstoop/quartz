## Recap
In their latest adventure in [[Emberhold]], a smaller party set out on a quest to hunt down a hostile beast threatening the town's livestock. They followed the trail deep into the woods and discovered an ancient cave with ruins. Within the ruins, they stumbled upon a relic that caught Hugo's interest.

Delving deeper into the cave, the party faced off against an owlbear and a group of goblins who revered it as their god. In a thrilling battle, they managed to defeat the threats, eliminating the danger to [[Emberhold]] and marking another chapter in their heroic journey.
