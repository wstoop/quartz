## Recap
In their inaugural adventure in [[Emberhold_TEXT|Emberhold]], the party of intrepid adventurers signed up as bodyguards for an exposition, bonding over drinks at the Weary Harper before the Grand Centennial Exposition. During the event, chaos ensued when a halfling scientist's invention was stolen, coinciding with an explosion aimed at stealing a relic from the Whispering Spire. Following clues, the party delved into the sewers, encountering both local wildlife and a nefarious group who had stolen these artifacts and brought them to their hideout. After defeating the group, they realized they were merely pawns in a larger scheme.
