  Welcome adventurers to the world of Aethel! This wiki is your companion as we delve into the ongoing campaign.

Here you will find information about the world, its lore, the characters you encounter, and the adventures you embark upon. The spoils of your victories and the burdens of your defeats will be chronicled here.

The wiki will be updated after each session, so be sure to check back often to discover new details, keep track of your progress, and relive your moments of triumph (and maybe some blunders) along the way.

Let the journey begin!
