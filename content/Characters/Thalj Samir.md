## Backstory  
Thalj Samir was born with a mutation causing his skin and hair to be extremely pale, this is where he got his name from. His parents loved him a lot, but he always used to get picked on by his peers, because of his pale appearance. Surprisingly, he doesn't have the red eyes albino people do. This is because he did have some pigment while in the womb, but his own body broke off the melanin, as the immune system can't get to the eyes, his eyes are their original colour. At 16, he ran away from home, feeling like an outcast in his town. He wrote his parents a letter promising them he would come back. He's been roaming, trying to survive all this time, eventually he was able to trade goods he found on the ground up to his first handgun. Becoming proficient with it, he now feels safer when traveling, although he doesn't intend to use the gun on people. His fascination for inventions grew as he travelled the world, even though he does not know how these things work, he like to look at them by breaking them apart
