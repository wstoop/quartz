## Backstory
Not a lot is know About Zuri, but the few things we do know are enough to explain the way she acts. Zuri is quite stubborn, she can sometimes act a bit too hot-headed and doesn't show a lot of sympathy. She likes to show people why she should be the one who comes up with the plan. It's also no surprise that she used to be a high ranking officer in the royal guard. However, she quit this position in search of bigger hurdles to overcome. The Royal Guard haven't forgotten her either, as she is still sometimes asked to fill in when needed.


## Description
Zuri is a big black woman with light blue eyes and quite a lot of scars on her forearms and calves. She has dark brown hair, which she puts up in a big bun, except for 2 locks which fall behind her pointy ears and rest on her shoulders. She sports a white tank top covered with pieces of leather armor, held together by a collection of brown belts. She carries a peculiar greatsword, one with a serrated edge.
