## Backstory
  George grew up in a fairly peaceful village of goliaths as the son of a warrior. His parents taught him from a young age how to behave like a good soldier. Despite having a good relationship with his family, he was sent to the army at a fairly young age to train. Now that he has completed his training and spent some time in the infantry, George has left the army and is going to travel the world as an adventurer to gain more experience and become stronger. This way, George could later protect his village against potential threats, which his mother is convinced will come. Due to his military upbringing, George listens very well to orders from someone stronger than him and has earned respect. This has led George to have a fairly hard time killing strong enemies unless they were truly evil. In addition, George despises ranged combat, preferring to face his enemies up close and personal, and he hates those who do fight from afar.
## Description
George boasts a fiery red beard that matches his unruly mane. Clad in chainmail armor that clinks with every step, he carries himself with the confidence of a seasoned warrior. Adorning his attire are pelts from the beasts he's conquered, serving as both trophies and protection. His piercing gaze hints at both kindness and ferocity, embodying strength and courage in every stride.
